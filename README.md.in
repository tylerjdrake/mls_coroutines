# About

Standard C++ looks like it is going to be getting coroutines eventually. But eventually is not **RIGHT NOW**.

With enough preprocessor abuse: **M**acros, **L**ambdas, and **S**witch-statements can be used to get something that looks a bit like coroutines.

Copy the header file, `"mls_coroutines.hpp"`, into your project and start writing coroutines!

## mls_coroutines.hpp
```C++
@MLS_COROUTINES_HPP@
```

## Sample Code
```C++
@TEST_CPP@
```
## Sample Code Output
```
@TEST_OUTPUT@
```

# Inspiration

Much of the macro machinery comes from here: [Simon Tatham's Coroutines in C](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html)
